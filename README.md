Web application to see different Pokemon and get their information.
Once loaded, you can click on any pokemon you'd like to see their name, height and types
Project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, ESLint
This project uses the pokedex api: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150'

I created a working pokedex by linking a public api to the project and created the modal.

I decided to continue with pokemon because I thought it would be less confusing while going ahead, but I would definitely try creating an application with a music API of some sort.

I learned much more about debugging and I learned a ton about APIs.  Also, there are many ways to do one thing.
